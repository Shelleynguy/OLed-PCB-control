# OLed-PCB-control

OLed-PCB-control is a custom PCB project for controlling an SSD1306 OLED display using an Arduino Nano and 3 user buttons, including an on/off latch power circuit. The project provides all necessary KiCad design files and manufacturing outputs for easy assembly and use.

## Features

- SSD1306 OLED screen interface (I2C)
- 3 user input buttons
- On/off latch power circuit for energy efficiency
- Designed for Arduino Nano integration
- Easy-to-manufacture PCB (tested with JLCPCB)
- Includes schematic, PCB layout, and component list such as the custom and assigned footrprints
